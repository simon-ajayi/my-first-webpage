    <h1>My Favorite Places</h1>

    <p>Everybody has a list of places that they like to go to either have fun, relax, eat or what have you. I'd like to share my favorite places with  you.</p>

    <h3>Home</h3>
    
    <p>This one might be an obvious one but i feel like it's still worth putting on the list. There's a reason that they say that there is no place like home. That's because home is where you can relax, where everything is familiar. As they say, "you can do you." My favorite rooms are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Living room</li>
      <li>Kitchen</li>
      <li>"Man Cave"</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Now the living room is a no brainer. It's where I hang out when I want to watch tv or a movie or just hang out. Essentually it's the go to room. I like the kitchen because I like cooking. I'm not going to win chopped or anything but I like baking and I have a few dishes that I like making. And then there's the man cave. That is where I usually go to play video games. <a href="epicodus/games.html">Here</a> a few of my favorites.</p>

    <h3>Beach</h3>
    <p>Living in Oregon you're never too far from the beach. Which is nice when you need to get rid of stress and running home just doesn't cut it, running to beach is always a good plan.</p>

    <h3>Newfoundland</h3>
    <p>Now I've only been here once but it made a lasting impression on me. Me and a group of friends got invited to go up there for a week and it was a really awesome expreience. We stayed in one of the small cities there and everybody treated you like family. It felt like home.</p>

    <p>Now, there are a lot of places I want to go to that I haven't crossed off my bucket list yet and things that I'm constantly adding so if you have any suggestions, hit me up here.</p>
